This was the first year my business was starting to work. Then I stopped. I stopped my progress because I involved someone else and tried to pivot to something I thought was higher. 

There’s nothing wrong with trying to pivot as there is more value in scaling the market, or opportunity, when you have one that is already working but that is the problem. The opportunity wasn’t working, I was. Then I stopped. So the money stopped as well. 

You want to make it really fast. You want to be a millionaire tomorrow. I understand what you are thinking about and how it feels to be desperate but when people say be patient they are not saying be patient with your drive they are saying be patient with prudence. 

You have probably already found the thing that will put you in position to be a millionaire in 5 years but you keep putting it down and starting the timer over because something else looks better. 

The work that it takes to get to the next level is boring. 

The constant reaching out, responding to emails fast, sales calls, dealing with clients, it’s boring. The fun comes in leveling up skills and growing vertically. Not in changing industries. 

You failed because your real obsession was with finding a shortcut. It isn’t with the work. That’s why you are failing. That’s how you let undeserving people into your structure. You want to get saved. 

If you were guaranteed to make a million if you did the boring stuff for 5 years that’s going to be the better path then risking not making it at all because you think every opportunity will bring you there in 90 days.
